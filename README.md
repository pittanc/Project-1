# Project-1

In this study, we explored how environmental conditions impact marathon performance across age and sex. Our results indicate that age and sex are the most significant predictors of performance, with men generally performing faster than women across all age groups, and marathon times increasing with age, particularly after the age of 60. 

Among the environmental factors, WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) had the most pronounced effect when not adjusting for other factors, as higher temperatures led to longer finishing times. However, AQI (Air Quality Index) and wind speed had only modest effects on performance, with minor differences observed across the binary categories of these variables.

When identifying the weather condition factor that has the most impact on marathon performance, the form of variables and the interactions among them is very complicated. 
Adjusting for other factors, a random forest model shows that the effects of weather conditions, such as WBGT, wind speed, and AQI, though present, are less substantial.
